                    The Makermodule plugin allows for extended functionality in Makermod that's not possible otherwise. Due to the plugin being entirely client-sided, the server you're connecting to won't need to add any additional files or have any extra work done to it
                    in order for the Makermodule to work.

                    The default wait command will lock the Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy client until the delay time has expired. While it does serve the purpose of allowing for breaks between commands, it has the obvious drawback of not allowing any interactions until
                    the wait has finished. This problem is only multiplied when you're using a script with multiple wait commands; this is unfortunately the case with many scripts if they're built properly.<br/><br/> The ontimer command
                    allows you to wait for a period of time with the added benefit of being able to do other tasks during the waiting period. The syntax is slightly different. Other than the delay being in milliseconds (1000th of a second) instead of
                    centiseconds (100th of a second), the ontimer is specified just before a set of commands (which are wrapped up in quotation marks); doing so will execute the string of commands after the delay has occured.

                <p class="content_code">
                    Example:<br/><br/> echo Starting script...;<br/> ontimer 2000 "echo This command executed 2 seconds after the script started";<br/> ontimer 4000 "echo This command executed 4 seconds after the script started";<br/> echo This command
                    actually executed just after the first echo;

                <p class="content_paneltext">
                    The markt command allows the player to mark the location they're targeting as the position for their next command. As an example, if you were looking at a player and typed markt the part of the player being targeted would be the location of your next
                    placed object.
